    <h1>Zemanta &mdash; Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
        This Content Provider Agreement (<strong><em>&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;</em></strong>) sets forth the legally binding terms between you, as an Agency or Advertiser (each as defined below), and Zemanta Inc., a Delaware corporation (<strong><em>&ldquo;Zemanta&rdquo;</em></strong>) with respect to your use of Zemanta’s DSP and/or EdNet advertising distribution platform services (the <strong><em>&ldquo;Advertising Services&rdquo;</em></strong>). By agreeing to a Zemanta online or offline written insertion order, whether by click-wrap consent or manual signature (each, an <strong><em>&ldquo;IO&rdquo;</em></strong>), you agree to be bound to the terms of this Agreement.  To the extent you do not agree to an IO, you may not use the Advertising Services and your use of any other Zemanta services or products shall be governed by Zemanta’s Terms of Service Agreement set forth at <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/about/related-posts-terms-of-service/">http://www.zemanta.com/about/related-posts-terms-of-service/</a> (the <strong><em>&ldquo;General Terms&rdquo;</em></strong>).  As set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement, certain provisions of the General Terms are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1.          Advertising Services.</strong>  Zemanta will use reasonable efforts to: (i) provide Advertising Services to you; (ii) make available advertising content you supply to Zemanta via Zemanta’s online content submission tools (the <strong><em>&ldquo;Ad(s)&rdquo;</em></strong>) to Zemanta’s network of end users who use Zemanta’s online publisher enhancement tools (collectively, the <strong><em>&ldquo;Zemanta Network Publishers&rdquo;</em></strong>) for use by Zemanta Network Publishers in accordance with the trafficking criteria set forth in an IO; and (iii) make available online reporting tools, which are generally broken out by day and summarized by creative execution, content area (Ad placement), and other variables defined in the IO (e.g., impressions, and/or clicks).  You acknowledge that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any IO (all of which are incorporated herein by reference), (a) Zemanta does not guarantee that the Zemanta Network Publishers shall incorporate your Ads into their respective online offerings (e.g., no minimum Deliverable requirements) and (b) Zemanta will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any Zemanta Network Publishers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.          Insertion Orders.</strong> An IO may either be submitted by an individual/company which desires to promote its products and services (an <strong><em>&ldquo;Advertiser&rdquo;</em></strong>), or by an advertising agency (an <strong><em>&ldquo;Agency&rdquo;</em></strong>) that represents the interests of an Advertiser (either an Advertiser, or an Advertiser and Agency, together, a <strong><em>&ldquo;Content Provider&rdquo;</em></strong>).   In either case, an IO will be binding upon the parties when confirmed by Zemanta that the IO was properly submitted (either by email or the Advertising Services’ user interface communication). Each IO shall specify: (i) the type(s) of inventory desired by Content Provider (e.g., impressions, clicks or other desired actions) (the <strong><em>&ldquo;Deliverables&rdquo;</em></strong>); (ii) the price(s) for such Deliverables (e.g., CPM rate, CPC rate); (iii) the maximum amount of money to be spent pursuant to the IO (if applicable); and (iv) the start and end dates of the campaign.  Other items that may be included in an IO, include (among others) geographic restrictions, device preferences, daily budget limits, and tracking codes.   If you are an Agency, as provided in Section 8 of this Agreement, you are required to represent and warrant that you have the authority as agent of and to bind the applicable Advertiser to this Agreement and each applicable IO. Agency agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Zemanta and its Affiliates (defined below) and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from any and all Losses (defined below) incurred as a result of Agency’s alleged breach of the foregoing sentence.

    <p>
        <strong>3.          Compensation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
        <strong>3.1       Invoices.</strong>   Without offset of any kind, Content Provider shall pay Zemanta for any Deliverables attained as determined by Zemanta's proprietary tracking tools.  By way of example and not limitation, if an IO provides for a $0.10 CPC Rate, Content Provider shall pay Zemanta $0.10 for each click-through to the applicable Ads.  Zemanta will generally issue invoices on or around the fifth (5th) day of each calendar month for Deliverables accrued in the preceding calendar month.  To the extent Content Provider has a credit card on file with Zemanta, Content Provider authorizes Zemanta to charge such card for the amount of any invoices. Content Provider’s billing address, as set forth in the IO, must include information reasonably specified by Content Provider, such as the IO number, Advertiser’s name, brand name or campaign name, and any number or other identifiable references required for invoicing on the IO.  Zemanta will provide performance metrics for the invoiced period, which may include access to online or electronic reporting.  All payments shall be made in United States dollars.
    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
        <strong>3.2       Payment Due Dates.</strong>  Content Provider will make payment thirty (30) days from receipt of invoice, or as otherwise stated in a payment schedule set forth in the applicable IO, if any.  To the extent Agency is representing an Advertiser, Zemanta may notify Agency that it has not received payment in such thirty (30) day period and whether it intends to seek payment directly from Advertiser, and may do so five (5) business days after providing such notice.  Late payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).  All charges are exclusive of taxes.  Content Provider will pay all taxes and other government charges (except for taxes on Zemanta’s income), and reasonable expenses and outside attorneys’ fees that Zemanta incurs in collecting late payments.  To the extent Content Provider has pre-paid for the Advertising Services, Zemanta shall be entitled to apply such pre-paid amounts towards any amounts owed hereunder.
    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
                        <strong>3.3       Payment Liability.</strong>  Unless otherwise set forth by Agency on an IO, Zemanta agrees to hold Agency liable for payments solely to the extent proceeds have cleared from the represented Advertiser to Agency for Ads placed in accordance with the IO. For sums not cleared to Agency, Zemanta agrees to hold Advertiser solely liable. Agency agrees to make every reasonable effort to collect and clear payment from Advertiser on a timely basis.  Upon the request of Zemanta, Agency will confirm whether Advertiser has paid to Agency in advance funds sufficient to make payments pursuant to the IO.
    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
                        <strong>3.4       DSP Clients – Managed Service Fee.</strong>  If the Advertising Services include DSP services and Content Provider’s media spend is less than $50,000 at time of cancellation or termination for any reason, Zemanta will charge a twenty-five percent (25%) managed service fee against the total media spend by the Content Provider.                                                                                                      

    </p>
    <p>                                  
        <strong>4.          Cancellation and Termination.</strong>  Unless earlier terminated, this Agreement will remain in effect until all IOs have terminated. Content Provider may cancel an IO for any reason by providing Zemanta written notice of cancellation which will be effective (i) for DSP services, within forty-eight (48) of Zemanta’s confirmation of receipt of the termination notice and (ii) for EdNet services, within thirty (30) days of Zemanta’s confirmation of receipt of the termination notice.  Either party may terminate an IO at any time if the other party is in material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not cured within 10 days after written notice thereof from the non-breaching party, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement with regard to specific breaches.

    <p>
        <strong>5.          Ad Materials.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
        <strong>5.1       Compliance with Policies.</strong>  It is Content Provider’s obligation to submit Ads in accordance with Zemanta’s advertising criteria or specifications (including content limitations, technical specifications, privacy policies, user experience policies, policies regarding consistency with Zemanta’s public image, community standards regarding obscenity or indecency, other editorial or advertising policies, and material due dates) (collectively, the <strong><em>&ldquo;Policies&rdquo;</em></strong>). 

    </p>
    <p class="level-two">
                        <strong>5.2       Rejection and Removal.</strong>  Zemanta reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to reject or remove from its network any Ads where the Ads (or the site to which the Ad is linked) do not comply with its Policies, or that in Zemanta’s sole reasonable judgment do not comply with any applicable law, regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. In addition, Zemanta reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to reject or remove from its network any Ads or links to the site connected with the Ad that may bring disparagement, ridicule, or scorn upon Zemanta or any of its Affiliates.
    </p>
    <p>
